    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "In many datasets topic modeling / Non-negative Matrix Factorization mayreveal better structure than PCA. Yet most data practitioners will still use SVD/PCA instead of NMF. One big reason is computation speed. There are very fast algorithms for SVD/PCA, but NMF algorithms remain very slow in comparison. In general it's inevitable as NMF is NP-hard whereas SVD is not. However, many applications fall into a smaller subset of NMF problem which are much more easily computable: they satisfy the [anchor word assumption](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.1956.pdf) allowing for reasonable noise. This observations allows for [very fast algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.4777.pdf). Yet it's rarely used in applications in text or gene expression data, as far as I am aware of. Here I want to investigate its issues, potential fixes, and applications. Ultimately I hope we can find an algorithm that's almost as fast as SVD/PCA, with good solution. \n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "Although it's hard to say whether the anchor-word assumption holds up in real data (allowing for reasonable noise), we can see [the NMF fit to real data largely satisfy the anchor assumption](https://zihao12.github.io/pyJSMF-RAW/real_data_anchor_word) (from text to gene expression data). Knowing that the solution falls within this much smaller subset, it's reasonable to try exploiting this property in computation. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Issues\n",
    "The anchor-word algorithm as presented in [this seminal paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.4777.pdf) requires the observation matrix to have each column/word/gene to sum to 1. The column-wise scaling amplifies noise for rare words. As a result, many rare words appear like anchor word only due to chance (say if a word only appears once in one document, which is purely loaded in one topic, then it must be an anchor word!!) This is investigated [here](https://zihao12.github.io/pyJSMF-RAW/issues_finding_anchor_word)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fixes\n",
    "\n",
    "* One direction is on relaxing the sum-to-one condition: [scale carefully](https://zihao12.github.io/pyJSMF-RAW/scaling_C) \n",
    "\n",
    "* The other direction is on denoising the observation matrix (which is high dimensional and sparse), especially for rare words. The best way so far is using the [MAGIC](https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0092-8674%2818%2930724-4) package to do [denoising](https://zihao12.github.io/pyJSMF-RAW/magic). Note that this is only good for finding anchor words: the shrinkage effect is too strong. \n",
    "    - We want a more principled approach to MAGIC. Main challenge is how to model the high-dimensional sparse count vector. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* I feel we need a few iterative steps to get a good solution: denoising step can be improved with better structural assumpption, and structure estimation can be improved with better denoising. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Usage\n",
    "* In some settings we can get really good initialization from anchor-word algorithm. Only a couple of iterations gets us very close to solution: [here](https://zihao12.github.io/pyJSMF-RAW/anchor_word_as_initialization) \n",
